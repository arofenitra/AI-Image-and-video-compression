# AI-Image-and-video-compression
This project investigates on how AI-based image and video compression affect several deep learning tasks such as classification, object detection, and edge detection. The project will use a dataset of images and videos, and will apply traditional-based compression methods such as JPEG 2000, JPEG, and deep learning-based compression methods such as autoencoders. 

The project will compare the performance of AI-based compression methods with traditional compression methods such as JPEG and ffmpeg. The project will also explore the impact of compression on the quality of the compressed images and videos, and the computational efficiency of the compression and decompression processes.
